This repository is a time-series adaptation of the Universal Robustness Evaluation Toolkit (for Evasion) - URET found at the following link: https://github.com/IBM/URET.git

URET is a tool for generating adversarial samples that can deceive an ML model into mispredicting a particular output.

In this repository, URET is integrated and tested on the Deep Residual Time Series Blood Glucose Forecasting model found at the following link: https://github.com/MLD3/Deep-Residual-Time-Series-Forecasting.git

The victim model was submitted to the Blood Glucose Level Prediction Challenge hosted by Ohio University and evaluated on the OhioT1DM dataset.
